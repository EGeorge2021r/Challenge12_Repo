# Challenge12_Repo
Using use supervised learning models to predict credit risk based on a dataset from a peer-to-peer lending services company

# User Story

•	Check for any class imbalance.
•	Apply sampling techniques and use machine learning models to make accurate predictions for imbalanced data.
•	Compare the classification models and sampling algorithms



# General information 
This project implementation involve the following:
•	Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets
•	Creating a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
•	Predicting a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data
•	Writing a Credit Risk Analysis Report
